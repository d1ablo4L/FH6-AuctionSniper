# Download

Download the latest version of **AuctionSniper.zip** from the [Releases page](https://github.com/d1ablo4L/AuctionSniper/releases) and extract it into any folder on your PC.

# How to use

## Step 1 – Open the Auction House

Launch Forza Horizon 6 and go to the Auction House on the festival site.

<img width="1916" height="971" alt="image-1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e4c412e-974e-4bf4-9d4d-bbc31fcd2432" />

---

## Step 2 – Configure the search

Open **Search Auctions** and set the filters:

- **Make** and **Model** of the car you want
- **Maximum buyout price** as a safety limit. The bot buys the first matching car without checking the price, so this is the most you can spend per car. Set it carefully.

Go back so the screen shows the main **Auction House Screen**. That's where the bot expects to start.

---

## Step 3 – Start the sniper

Right-click **AuctionSniper.exe** and **run as administrator**. A small overlay will appear in the top-right corner of the screen.

Go back to FH6, press **F8** or **Start**, and let it run.

To stop: press **F8** again, **F9** for emergency stop, or click **STOP** on the overlay.

# SmartScreen warning

Windows SmartScreen will show a warning because the exe is not digitally signed. To run it anyway:

1. Click **More info**
2. Click **Run anyway**

---

# Hotkeys

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| **F8** | Start / stop |
| **F9** | Emergency stop |
| **STOP** button | Same as F8 |
| **✕** on the overlay | Close and exit |

---

# Important

> [!WARNING]
> - Automating the Auction House may violate the Forza Code of Conduct.
> - Results may vary depending on your PC and network setup.
> - You risk a warning, a suspension or a permanent ban.
> - Use it at your own risk.

---

# Notes

- The bot only works while FH6 is the active window. The overlay shows **Paused** if you switch to another window. Click the game again to resume.
- The overlay is hidden from screen captures, so you can leave it anywhere on screen.
- Drag the overlay by clicking and holding the title bar.
- You won't win every snipe. The bot is limited by FH6's menu animations and the auction server's response, like any other tool.
- If the servers are slow or overloaded, the bot may stop working correctly (a fix is coming soon).

---

# Troubleshooting

**The overlay shows "Paused"** – FH6 is not the active window. Click the game.

**F8 does nothing** – another app on your PC may be intercepting the F8 key. Close it, or change the hotkey in the settings.

**The bot gets lost on a screen and freezes** – restart FH6 and the bot. Make sure the graphics preset is **Very Low** and the resolution matches one of the supported options. Use **Diagnostic Mode** to check match thresholds if you run HDR or custom templates.

**When reporting bot-related issues** – include the Sniper.log file so I can analyze it. If the problem persists, [open an issue](https://github.com/d1ablo4L/AuctionSniper/issues)
